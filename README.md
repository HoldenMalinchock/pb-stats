Pickleball stats for you and others

I love stats for things I do and I like to track my progess and performance with some tangible data.

As an avid pickleball player I love that pro broadcasts will rarely display shot charts for players to show where they hit their shots to.  I have the ability to track this myself with film.  And why not track others you play with to give yourself an advantage.

Here is my concept:
INSERT DOWNLOADED PICTURE.

## Starting scope
- Player creation
- List players to select for data
- Stat page for a player to see their current stats
- Game page to track the shot locations for a player

## Ideas:
First cuts will be simple in features as it could get complex fast.  As I deem ideas out of scope I will write them here to track ideas to implement later.  There are lots of places this app can expand to.
- Track Serve Location (Lots of interesting questions to answer about this one)
- Track winning shots
- Dink ralley shot counts
- Track aces
- Track forehand/backhand drop counts + sucess rate (We would need special page for these as this could get hard to track in real time with other things)
